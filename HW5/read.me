Objective --> 
        Develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        The game should allow two players to take turns, check for a winner 
        or a draw after each move, and provide a reset functionality to restart the game.
Requirements:
1.	Game Interface:
    a.	Create a 3x3 grid using HTML <div> elements.
    b.	Add a section to display the current player's turn or the game result (win or draw).
    c.	Add a "Restart Game" button that resets the game.
2.	Game Functionality:
    a.	Players (X and O) should take turns by clicking on the grid cells.
    b.	The game should prevent players from selecting an already filled cell.
    c.	Check for a winner after each turn. A winner is determined if one player fills a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol (X or O).
d.	If all cells are filled and no winner is found, display a "It's a draw!" message.
    3.	JavaScript Logic:
    a.	Use an array to track the game state (which cells are filled with X or O).
    b.	Implement a function to check if there is a winning combination after each move.
    c.	Implement a function to reset the game when the "Restart Game" button is clicked.
4.	CSS:
    a.	Style the grid to display as a 3x3 board.
    b.	Add hover effects and basic animations to improve user experience.
